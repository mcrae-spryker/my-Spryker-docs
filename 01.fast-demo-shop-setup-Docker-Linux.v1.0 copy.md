## WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE

* simple installation steps via command line
* get the Spryker B2C public demo shop from Spryker's public Github repo
* steps to get the Docker demo shop running running smoothly on an Ubuntu 22.04.x (preferrable LTS) using Ubuntu standard repos
* verify we can log in to the different front-end & back-end pages



## REQUIREMENTS

### PHYSICAL MACHINE OR VM
* 8GB (minimal! 4GB will not load the B2C shop)
* 2x vCPUs
    
### SOFTWARE TOOLS WE WILL BE USING (steps 1 - 4)
1. chrome web browser: https://www.google.com
```bash
cd Downloads
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

2. Install git
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

3. vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

```bash
cd Downloads
sudo apt install ./code_whatever-latest-version.deb
```
    
4. Install the docker community edition and docker compose from Ubuntu standard repos
    * You do NOT need Docker Desktop for Linux!
    * The Spryker notes around enabling BuildKit are a bit out-of-date.
        Since the release of Docker 20.10, BuildKit is now stable. 
        You’re probably already using it if you’re on macOS or Windows, 
        and starting with version 23.0 (released early 2023)
        it is enabled by default on Linux as well.
    
Install docker community edition (Ubuntu repos)
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
docker version
# should show 
    Docker version 20.10.21, build 20.10.21-0ubuntu1~22.04.3
```
    
Install docker-compose (Ubuntu repos)
```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
docker-compose version
# shows version 1.29 which works just fine without us needing to do anything else!
    docker-compose version 1.29.2, build unknown
```



## GETTING STARTED WITH SPRYKER DEMO SHOP

Create a new folder and navigate into it, example for all your git repos
```bash
mkdir git
``` 
    
Change diretory
```bash
cd git
``` 
    
Download the latest version of Spryker with git clone, example for B2C demo shop version 202212.0
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop.git -b 202212.0-p2 --single-branch ./b2c-demo-shop
``` 
        
Navigate to your cloned folder. Example for B2C demo shop
```bash
cd b2c-demo-shop
``` 
        
Download Docker SDK
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git --single-branch docker
``` 
        
Build Spryker docker containers
```bash
docker/sdk bootstrap deploy.dev.yml
``` 
        

You are expected to cut & paste everything from sudo bash to /etc/hosts"
```bash
EXAMPLE OUTPUT
--------------------
Using deploy.dev.yml 

Running generator 
-->  DEVELOPMENT MODE   

Please, run the following commands in order to prepare the environment: 

sudo bash -c "echo '127.0.0.1 backend-api.at.spryker.local..plus a whole bunch of other stuff in the middle..local' >> /etc/hosts"

``` 
        


## DAILY DEVELOPMENT
This command does not need to be run every time, only the first time OR if something went wrong with your containers
```bash
docker/sdk up
``` 

Now we can check these pages and log into different areas of our local environment

* dashboard http://spryker.local
* Rabbit MQ (broker) http://queue.spryker.local
```bash
    Username: spryker
    Password: secret
```

* Front-end http://yves.de.spryker.local/
```bash
    Username: sonia@spryker.com
    Password: change123
```

* Backoffice backoffice.de.spryker.local
```bash
    Username: admin@spryker.com
    Password: change123
```

* Jenkins scheduler http://scheduler.spryker.local
* mail_catcher http://mail.spryker.local
* Swagger http://swagger.spryker.local
* Redis-gui http://redis-commander.spryker.local


When doing a demo and needing demo (fake) products, data, videos and injecting into your demo shop
```bash
docker/sdk up --build --assets --data 
    --build (update composer, generate transfer objects, etc.)
    --assets (build assets)
    --data (get new demo data)
```

See all running containers
```bash
docker ps 
```

    
Stop all containers running on your local envirnment
```bash
docker/sdk stop

```

The day-to-day working with your local developer environment
```bash
docker/sdk start
```


When you're finished with the project and want to clear the containers
```bash
docker/sdk down 
```


## UNINSTALLING EVERYTING (from inside the shop folder)
```bash
docker/sdk down
rm -rf b2c-demo-shop
```


## NOTES:
* Suggest doing the Spryker basic training course
